### Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the 2020 U.S. presidential election results using a dataset that includes county-wise vote shares, demographic data, and socioeconomic indicators. The goal is to provide insights into voting patterns and demographic influences, along with a deployed election prediction model.

### Project Structure
- **Data Analysis**: Insights are derived through visualizations, descriptive statistics, and a review of missing values.
- **Prediction Dashboard**: A deployed prediction model on Render allows users to enter demographic information and predict election outcomes based on 2020 trends.

### 1. Insights from Visualizations

#### Mean Vote Percentage by Party
- **Visualization**: A bar plot displays the average vote percentages for Democratic, Republican, and Other parties.
- **Insight**: The average Republican vote percentage (64.79%) is significantly higher than the Democratic (33.42%) and Other candidates (1.79%), indicating a Republican preference overall.

#### Distribution of Voting Percentages
- **Visualization**: A histogram shows the distribution of Democratic and Republican vote percentages.
- **Insight**: The bimodal distribution suggests geographic polarization, with certain areas favoring one party heavily over the other.

#### Democratic Vote Distribution
- **Insight**: The right-skewed histogram shows that while most counties have lower Democratic support, a few regions show high support, indicating a minority with concentrated Democratic leanings.

#### Republican Vote Distribution
- **Insight**: The Republican vote histogram is skewed towards higher percentages, highlighting strong support in many counties, which reinforces the party's dominance in these regions.

#### Occupational Distribution
- **Visualization**: A pie chart shows the average employment distribution across occupation categories.
- **Insight**: Most of the workforce is employed in Management, business, science, and arts occupations (34.18%), reflecting a socioeconomic structure that may correlate with voting behaviors.

#### Educational Attainment and Voting Patterns
- **Insight**: Analysis of educational attainment variability across counties shows a potential correlation between education and voting patterns, as education levels often influence political preferences.

### 3. Descriptive Statistics

#### Summary Statistics
- **Key Metrics**: For each numerical column, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, percentiles) were calculated.

#### Key Voting Statistics

| Metric                 | Democrat Vote % | Republican Vote % | Other Vote % |
|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Mean                   | 33.42%          | 64.79%            | 1.79%        |
| Standard Deviation     | 16.04%          | 16.23%            | 0.88%        |
| Median                 | 30.05%          | 68.16%            | 1.67%        |
| Maximum                | 95.83%          | 96.18%            | 13.00%       |

**Insight**: The mean Democratic vote percentage is 33.42%, while the Republican mean is 64.79%. These values and their standard deviations suggest variability in party support across counties, highlighting geographic polarization.
